## Creating signs
You can create world signs to teleport the player to a world or command signs which are running a specific command when the player touches it.

### World
To create a world sign which teleports the player to a specific world when he/she is touching it and is showing how many players are in that world, just create a sign like this and touch it.

2. The name of the world (e.g. lobby)
3. Description of the world.  
4. Nothing (Leave blank)
